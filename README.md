# BoxesOfLife

[![Angular Build](https://github.com/hieronymusma/boxes-of-life/actions/workflows/angular-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hieronymusma/boxes-of-life/actions/workflows/angular-build.yml)  
Boxes of Life draws a box for each week of a 90-year life.
You can enter your birthday and it shows how many boxes you already lived.  
I hope this let you stay motivated through out your life and prevents you from procrastination.  
The project was inspired by the TED Talk of Tim Urban about Procrastination (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU&t=15s).
